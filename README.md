# AdventOfCode2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Approach

I generally strive to implement the solutions myself to sharpen my problem-solving skills. However, there are occasions when I leverage GitHub Copilot—partly due to time constraints, but also out of genuine curiosity about how well different AI models perform on algorithmic challenges. This hybrid approach allows me to learn both from crafting solutions independently and from observing AI-assisted problem-solving patterns.

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Solution |
